# CodePath-Week-9


Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:
Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP

Any issues you encountered:
mhm-admin machine's external IP address failed to open the console several times, an issue also encountered by many of my classmates
JSON files did not export

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.:
By the time I closed the assignment, there were approximately 20,000 honeypot attacks and counting. Malware samples could not be detected, but this could be attributed to the type of honeypot chosen for the assignment. Attacks came from not just the US but from other countries, including those of the Asian continent, and these attacks of foreign origin were not organized in a way conducive to a steady stream; instead, at times there would be a sudden influx of attacks, and periods of silence.

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected:
